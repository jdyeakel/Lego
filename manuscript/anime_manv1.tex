Amazing words. The best words.

{\bf Effects of engineers on community richness} 

% Negative effects of engineering at the scale of the community
% The effect of engineers on extinction cascade size
Increasing the number of engineers (species with $m \leftrightarrow n$ interactions with their respective objects) at time $t$ results in the potential for larger extinction cascades at time $t+1$, and this correlation increases with the number of engineers in the community.
This positive correlation between the number of objects at time $t$ and extinction cascade size at time $t+1$ results from the increasing interconnectedness that results from the higher number of objects relative to species in the system.
Because the existence of a given object is tied to the species that makes them (one or multiple), the effects of primary extinctions are magnified.
This correlation saturates as the proportion of engineers -- object to species ratio -- increases, and this MAY be due to redundant engineering.

% The effect of engineering colonization facilitation
Object richness is strongly positively correlated with the number of potential colonizers.
So from a species packing perspective, engineering enables successful colonization by increasing niche space.
