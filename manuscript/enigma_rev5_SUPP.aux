\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces  Left: Assembly of communities over time results in steady state species richness by ca. time-step 250. Right: Trophic connectance early in assembly is high because a small number of species interact with each other such that the proportion of realized interactions (out of all possible interactions) is closer to unity. Over time, connectance decays as species richness increases, and the density of trophic interactions declines. Boxplots are composed of simulation replicates, with the mean value denoted by the central bar.

Left column: species-specific persistence as a function of trophic in-degree (the number of prey a species has; top) and out-degree (the number of predators a species has; bottom). Right column: species-specific persistence as a function of the mutualism in-degree (the number of service donors a species has; top) and out-degree (the number of service receivers a species has; bottom). As the trophic in- and out-degree of species increases, competition strength is lowered and persistence decreases. As the mutualism in-degree increases, so does the number of service donors that are needed for the receiving species to remain in the community. This introduces structural constraints that lowers persistence. Boxplots are composed of simulation replicates, with the mean value denoted by the central bar.

Species-specific persistence as a function of \textbf  {c}, trophic in-degree (number of resources a species has; top) and \textbf  {d}, out-degree (number of consumers that eat the species; bottom) when engineers are rare ($\eta = 0.5$). The notion that having a small number of engineers and modifiers in the community increases rates of primary extinction (Fig.\ 4a) by stabilizing consumers at the expense of their prey is supported by \emph  {i}) increased persistence of generalist consumers, and \emph  {ii}) the presence of species with larger number of predators. Species-specific persistence as a function of \textbf  {e}, trophic in-degree (number of resources a species has; top) and \textbf  {f}, out-degree (number of consumers that eat the species; bottom) when engineers are common ($\eta = 2.0$). The notion that a large number of engineers and modifiers in the community decrease rates of primary extinction (Fig.\ 4a) due to expanding niche space (diffusing the effects of competitive exclusion) is supported by the lack of correlation between trophic in/out-degree and persistence.
