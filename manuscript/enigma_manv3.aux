\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces  An example of the source pool interaction matrix where $\mathcal  {S} = 50$. Species and objects are aligned across the rows and columns; objects are shaded and labeled by `o' to distinguish them from species. The interaction recorded in row $i$ and column $j$ describes the directed interaction from species/object $i$ to species/object $j$. The first row/column represents the basal resource; species that assimilate the primary resource are capable of primary production. Species interact with other species and/or objects; objects only interact with their engineers by `needing' them; objects do not interact with other objects. }}{1}{}}
