Right column: species-specific persistence as a function of the mutualism in-degree (the number of service receivers a species has; top) and out-degree (the number of service providers a species has; bottom). As the trophic in- and out-degree of species increases, competition strength is lowered and persistence decreases. As the mutualism in-degree increases, so does the number of service donors that are needed for the receiving species to remain in the community. This introduces structural constraints that lowers persistence. }}{16}{}}
