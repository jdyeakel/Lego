# Description 

*	Iteratively build a template - how many different communities emerge?
* 	What does this depend on? (number of primary producers, generality of founding species, etc
*	Dependency of `n` interaction vs. template size
*	Sensitivity of *anime* communities vs. traditional trophic networks (with `n` and `m` at zero probability)
